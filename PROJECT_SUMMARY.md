## 🎯 Executive Summary

**PromotionHub** is a SaaS marketplace platform that digitalizes the outdoor advertising market in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. It connects billboard owners (supply) with advertisers/agencies (demand) through an elegant web and mobile platform.

### The Problem
- Billboards in Abidjan sit empty with only phone numbers
- No centralized marketplace
- Inefficient negotiations
- No transparency in pricing or availability
- Missing transaction verification

### The Solution
- Unified marketplace platform
- Instant booking and payments
- Digital contracts and photo verification
- Real-time analytics
- Network effects driving growth

### The Opportunity
- First-mover in African market
- High revenue potential (70% gross margins)
- Scalable to other African cities
- Adjacent revenue streams (design, management, financing)

---

## 📈 Market Opportunity

### Target Market
- **Primary:** Abidjan (capital, most advertising spend)
- **Secondary:** Other Ivorian cities (Yamoussoukro, Bouaké)
- **Tertiary:** West African expansion (Senegal, Cameroon, etc.)

### Market Size
- Estimated 5,000+ billboards in Abidjan
- Average monthly rental: 500K - 2M XOF
- Total addressable market: 2.5B+ XOF annually
- Our target (Year 1): 500 active billboards @ 1M avg = 500M XOF transactions = 50M XOF revenue

---

## 🏆 Key Differentiators

1. **Photo Verification** - Proof that ads are actually displayed (blockchain-ready)
2. **AI Matching** - Smart algorithm recommends best billboards (Phase 2)
3. **Mobile-First** - Works perfectly on phones (important in Africa)
4. **Local Payment** - Orange Money & MTN directly integrated
5. **First-Mover** - No competitors in space yet
